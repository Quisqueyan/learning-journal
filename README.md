# Learning-Journal
My name is Stanley and this is my first page on **GITHUB** and i want to discuss the growth mindset.
## growth mindset
I believe a *growth mindset* is having the knowledge that everyone is an apprentice to new tasks and that the master is the one that has attempted and learned the most from all he's failures.
### Reminders
* No one was born knowing how to ride a bicycle.
* Knowing that you failed builds confidence when you succeed.
* when you see someone succeed, it does not mean there were no failures.
#### examples
* My [markdown](https://quisqueyan.github.io/learning-journal/markdown) page has some examples of things i learned through trial an error
