# Learning-Journal
Welcome to my page.
I'm Stanley and im trying to lear the basics of coding. this is my first page and i built it using Git and GitHub for my repository.
## growth mindset
I believe a *growth mindset* is having the knowledge that everyone is an apprentice to new tasks and that the master is the one that has attempted and learned the most from all he's failures.
### Reminders
* No one was born knowing how to ride a bicycle.
* Knowing that you failed builds confidence when you succeed.
* when you see someone succeed, it does not mean there were no failures.
