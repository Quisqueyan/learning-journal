# Choosing a text editor
>During this lesson, I learned a vast amount of information about the capabilities of a text editor.

I believe the key take away from this lesson was that a text editor does not have to be a simple program that sits an waits for you to build your masterpiece. A text editor can be an interactive partner that makes suggestions to what may be wrong with your code, which helps you stay organized and even tries to predict some of what you're doing and completes your code.
