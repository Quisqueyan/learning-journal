Computers receive input from the user that data is stored in memory. The information in mind is taken by the processor and pushed through an algorithm then returned to memory.
The output is the information that is sent out to the user or to another system.
Computers use a binary number system that consists of 0 & 1 to represent information trough turning each wire on or off. This same process is used with text by assigning each letter a combination of 1 & 0; any text can be represented.
Images and videos are represented by pixels. Each pixel is assigned a combination of numbers and computer process and combine these to show a picture or image.
Sound in a system is also represented with numbers. By measuring sound in a waveform and assigning each wave point a number.
All the 0 & 1 are combined with circuits and processed the information we want to display.
