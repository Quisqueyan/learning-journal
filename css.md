# css Basics

### Cascading Style sheets

are used to style your file or site. CSS can be used within you HTML page or on its own style page.
*using an independent style page is favorable specially if a sit has several web pages, it also allows you to change style by altering just one file*

* rules follow a cascading order if two rules are the same the second rule will take precedence.

* if one selector is more specific than than another the more specific will take precedence.
##### you can add *!important* after property and it will take precedence.

* inherited values like font or text color will apply to all child elements. values like background color are not.

* different browsers can render a page in different way test your work several browsers.

### Box Model 

The CSS box model is essentially a box that wraps around every HTML element. It consists of: margins, borders, padding, and the actual content.

### Design web pages with CSS

* CSS treats elements as if they are inside boxes and allows you to create rules that control how each element inside that box is presented.

* CSS Rules consist of two parts *selector* and *declaration*.
    #### Selector
        indicates what element the rule applies to. (the same rule can apply to more than one element if you separate the elements names with commas).
    #### Declaration
        sits inside curly brackets and indicates how the element should be styled. ( consist of a property and a value)
